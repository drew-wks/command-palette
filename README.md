Command Palette  VSCode Extension


This extension will add command palette button to status bar in the right-bottom of your VSCode editor.
This a simple extension to quickly access the command palette instead of remembering keyboard shortcut.


99% of the credit goes to natqe whose extension I forked and modified to work for the command palette.
